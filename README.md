# Open Source Project Generator 🏗️💡🔧

An easy to use boilerplate for open source projects with the following features:

1. **README.md**: This file serves as the main documentation for your project. It provides an overview of what the project does, how to install it, how to use it, and any other relevant information that users and contributors might need to know. It is essential for helping others understand your project and get involved.

2. **LICENSE**: The license file is a crucial component of any open-source project. It specifies the terms under which the project's code and other assets are made available to others. It provides legal protection and ensures that everyone using or contributing to the project abides by the set rules.

3. **CONTRIBUTING.md**: This file outlines the guidelines for other developers who want to contribute to your project. It covers various aspects, such as how to set up the development environment, coding standards, submitting pull requests, and handling issues. Providing clear contribution guidelines encourages collaboration and streamlines the process of receiving contributions from the community.

4. **CHANGELOG.md**: The changelog file maintains a record of all changes made to the project over time. It usually follows a structured format, listing version numbers, release dates, and a summary of changes for each version. This allows users and contributors to track the evolution of the project and understand what improvements or bug fixes have been introduced in each release.

5. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: The code of conduct outlines the expected behavior and interactions among project contributors and users. It sets a standard for respectful and inclusive communication, helping maintain a positive and welcoming community around the project.
